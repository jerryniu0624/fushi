自我介绍

各位老师，大家上午好！我叫牛远卓。我主要从以下三方面介绍自己：英语、数学和编程。在英语方面，我雅思总分7.5，其中阅读9.0，写作6.5；2020/2021NECCS省级二等奖；在2022MCM中负责英语论文写作，在一个只有两人的队伍中获得参与奖。在数学中，我主要是校内数学考试，除了离散数学，全部上了90；最近准备这场考试的时候，看了些关于贝叶斯公式和特征根、特征向量的资料。在编程中，我在2021年暑假去Plantdata做Java开发实习生，并将过程记录在简数这个网站上，累计浏览量有4000多；和人工智能有关的编程的话，主要是在2021 AI Master和以前的各种大作业中，对别人代码进行调优：通常方法是先可视化training loss和generation loss，如果前者高，就用learning rate，data preprocessing，weight initialization，batch normalization和optimization方面改善；如果是后者高，就从Data augmentation ，Weight decay 和Dropout方面考虑。还看了一本百度出的Neural Network and Deep learning in Practice，解答了一些我以前在可视化的问题，加深了人工智能框架的理解。

Self-introduction

Good morning, all teachers! My name is Niu Yuanzhuo. I will introduce myself in the following three aspects: English, mathematics and programming. In English, I have an overall IELTS score of 7.5, including 9.0 in reading and 6.5 in writing; I won the second prize at the provincial level in NECCS twice; I was in charge of English essay writing in 2022 MCM, and won the  successful participation prize in a team of only two people. In math, I  got 90+ on all on-campus math exam except discrete math;, and recently read some information to understand the Bayesian formulas and eigenvectors and eigenvectors in preparation for this exam. In programming, I went to Plantdata as a Java development intern to successfully implemrnt the  360 multi files uploading and downloading system by springboot, and update the result into Mongodb database, and recorded all process on the website called "Jianshu", which has accumulated more than 4,000 views; in programming related to artificial intelligence, I mainly fine-tuned other people's code in 2021 AI Master and various previous big assignments. The usual schedule is to first visualize training loss and generation loss, if the former is high, I can try to change learning rate, data preprocessing, weight initialization, batch normalization and optimization; if the latter is high, try Data augmentation, Weight decay and Dropout. I also read a book called Neural Network and Deep learning in Practice written by Baidu, which answered some of my previous questions in visualization and deepened my understanding of AI framework.
